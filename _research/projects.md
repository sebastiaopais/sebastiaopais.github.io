## [PAM4WELLNESS](https://pam4wellness.ubi.pt/)
> This work was supported by Portugal 2020 – Centro 2020 – European Regional Development Fund | Reference: POCI-01-0246-FEDER-181319 | Ongoing (28 months) - Started: 2021 Ends: 2023

The project's main objective is to enhance the technical-scientific knowledge in the field of aromatic and medicinal plants (PAM), in business and R&D entities, through agile and effective transfer processes for companies, aiming at the economic and commercial valorization of the PAM's value chain - health and well-being.

## [HORUS 360º iOMS inteligente Offender Management System](http://www.ubi.pt/Ficheiros/Entidades/91474/Horus360_Ficha%20de%20projeto.pdf)
>This work was supported by Portugal 2020 – Centro 2020 – European Regional Development Fund | Reference: CENTRO-01-0247-FEDER-113066 | Ongoing (28 months) - Started: 2021 Ends: 2023

The HORUS 360 iOMS project aims to research and design a solution that supports the management of operations and information generated during the detention “life cycle”, imprisonment or surveillance of persons subject to custodial and non-custodial judicial measures. Through Artificial Intelligence and Predictive Analysis technology, the solution also supports the rehabilitation process and judicial or administrative decision-making processes.

## [MOVES](http://moves.di.ubi.pt/)
> This work was supported by National Founding from the FCT - Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia | Reference: PTDC/EEI-AUT/28918/2017 | Ongoing (48 months) - Started: 2018 Ends: 2022

Within this project, we propose to develop a multilingual surveillance system capable of detecting emerging crowds by identifying rising events that foster high focus, high energy and high emotion on social media. Our fundamental hypothesis is that virtual crowds evidence similar characteristics to real crowds, which may allow their modelization in terms of complex computer systems by relying on advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques. The current project lays at the intersection of important scientific research topics, namely urban informatics, natural language processing for social media, predictive analytics over big social data and image semtiment analysis.
